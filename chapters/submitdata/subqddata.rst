====================================

.. include:: ../../shared/variables.rst
.. include:: ../../shared/targets.rst

An observatory can send quasi-definitive data to its assigned
GIN via email or web upload. Quasi-definitive data should be
sent within 3 months of acquisition, however INTERMAGNET
encourages observatories to submit quasi-definitive data as
soon as possible, preferadly in IAGA-2002 data format with the
file name and data type set to quasi-definitive.
