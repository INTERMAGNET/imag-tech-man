Producing Quasi-Definitive Data
===============================

.. include:: ../../appendices/appendices.rst


The production of quasi-definitive data is similar to the
process for definitive data, the difference being that
quasi-definitive data are submitted within 3 months of
acquisition. Provided quasi-definitive data are produced using
the best available baselines such that data meet the
specification given in |app_imag_term|, any method can be
used. Observatories typically adopt the same process to produce
quasi-definitive data as they do for definitive data as this
simplifies the production of definitive data at the end of
the year. Examples of processes used by some institutes are
listed in :numref:`sub_dat_qd_data_ref`.
